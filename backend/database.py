"""
Database Configuration and Connection Management

This module is responsible for:
1. Managing the MongoDB connection (using Motor, the async driver for MongoDB).
2. Initializing and storing a reference to the database.
3. Creating required indexes for collections (users, notes).
4. Exposing helper functions to access specific collections (users, notes).

It ensures that:
- The database connection is established before the app starts serving requests.
- The connection is cleanly closed when the app shuts down.
- Indexes are created upfront for query performance and data integrity.
